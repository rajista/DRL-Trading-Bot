ü§ñ AI Trading Bot with Deep Reinforcement Learning
This project is a Python-based AI trading agent that learns to trade financial assets like cryptocurrencies or stock indices using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The agent uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an LSTM layer to analyze market data and make trading decisions.

The goal of this repository is to provide a clear and educational implementation of a reinforcement learning trading bot, demonstrating how modern AI techniques can be applied to financial markets.

‚ú® Features
Custom Trading Environment: Built using the gym.Env framework to simulate market interactions.

Deep Q-Network (DQN): The core algorithm for learning the optimal trading policy.

LSTM Neural Network: The agent's "brain" is an LSTM-based network built with PyTorch, ideal for processing time-series data like price history.

Risk Management: Includes built-in stop-loss and take-profit logic to manage risk during trades.

Data Handling: Uses the yfinance library to fetch historical market data and scikit-learn for data normalization.

üîß How It Works
The project is based on the principles of Reinforcement Learning.

The Environment (CryptoTradingEnv): This class acts as the simulated market. It provides the agent with market data (the state), defines the possible actions (Buy, Sell, Hold), and calculates the reward (profit or loss) after each action.

The Agent (DQNAgent): The agent observes the state from the environment and uses its neural network (DQN_LSTM) to choose the best action.

The Learning Process: The agent performs actions in the environment and stores the experiences (state, action, reward, next_state) in its memory. It then replays these memories to train its neural network, gradually learning which actions lead to the highest rewards over time. This is known as Q-Learning.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DRL-Trading-Bot.git
cd DRL-Trading-Bot
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required libraries:
A requirements.txt file is included for easy setup.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To start the training process, simply run the main script:

Bash

python drl_trading_btc2.py
The script will begin fetching data and training the agent for the number of episodes specified in the train_dqn function. You can monitor the progress in your terminal.

To train on a different asset, you can modify the symbol parameter in the CryptoTradingEnv class initialization within the train_dqn function.
